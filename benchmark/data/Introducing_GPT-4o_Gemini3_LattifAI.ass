Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.60,0:00:13.08,Default,Mira Murati:,0,0,0,,Hi everyone.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.36,0:00:16.22,Default,,0,0,0,,Hi everyone.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.28,0:00:16.96,Default,,0,0,0,,Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.96,0:00:17.58,Default,,0,0,0,,Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.22,0:00:20.24,Default,,0,0,0,,It's great to have you here today.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.68,0:00:23.08,Default,,0,0,0,,Today I'm going to talk about three things.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.38,0:00:24.16,Default,,0,0,0,,That's it.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.50,0:00:33.62,Default,,0,0,0,,We will start with why it's so important to us to have a product that we can make freely available and broadly available to everyone.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.14,0:00:41.30,Default,,0,0,0,,And we're always trying to find out ways to reduce friction so everyone can use ChatGPT wherever they are.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.38,0:00:51.94,Default,,0,0,0,,So today we'll be releasing the desktop version of ChatGPT and the refreshed UI that makes it simpler to use, much more natural as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.06,0:00:57.92,Default,,0,0,0,,But the big news today is that we are launching our new flagship model.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:58.44,0:01:00.74,Default,,0,0,0,,And we are calling it GPT-4o.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.92,0:01:11.22,Default,,0,0,0,,The special thing about GPT-4o is that it brings GPT-4 level intelligence to everyone, including our free users.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.82,0:01:18.40,Default,,0,0,0,,We'll be showing some live demos today to show the full extent of the capabilities of our new model.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:18.68,0:01:22.80,Default,,0,0,0,,And we'll be rolling them out iteratively over the next few weeks.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.60,0:01:26.12,Default,,0,0,0,,All right, so let's get started.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.24,0:01:35.80,Default,,0,0,0,,A very important part of our mission is to be able to make our advanced AI tools available to everyone for free.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.58,0:01:43.12,Default,,0,0,0,,We think it's very, very important that people have an intuitive feel for what the technology can do.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.24,0:01:48.00,Default,,0,0,0,,And so we really want to pair it with this broader understanding.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.60,0:01:52.02,Default,,0,0,0,,And we're always finding ways to reduce that friction.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.02,0:01:56.04,Default,,0,0,0,,And recently we made ChatGPT available without the signup flow.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.02,0:02:05.72,Default,,0,0,0,,And today we're also bringing the desktop app to ChatGPT because we want you to be able to use it wherever you are.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.84,0:02:11.92,Default,,0,0,0,,As you can see, it's easy, it's simple, it integrates very, very easily in your workflow.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.86,0:02:16.50,Default,,0,0,0,,Along with it, we have also refreshed the UI.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.76,0:02:34.72,Default,,0,0,0,,We know that these models get more and more complex, but we want the experience of interaction to actually become more natural, easy, and for you not to focus on the UI at all, but just focus on the collaboration with ChatGPT.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.84,0:02:37.96,Default,Mira Murati:,0,0,0,,And now the big news.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.90,0:02:42.92,Default,,0,0,0,,Today, we are releasing our newest flagship model.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.42,0:02:44.96,Default,,0,0,0,,This is GPT-4o.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.98,0:03:04.74,Default,,0,0,0,,GPT-4o provides GPT-4 level intelligence, but it is much faster and it improves on its capabilities across text, vision, and audio.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.62,0:03:13.10,Default,,0,0,0,,For the past couple of years, we've been very focused on improving the intelligence of these models and they've gotten pretty good.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.96,0:03:20.66,Default,,0,0,0,,But this is the first time that we are really making a huge step forward when it comes to the ease of use.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.76,0:03:30.22,Default,,0,0,0,,And this is incredibly important because we're looking at the future of interaction between ourselves and the machine.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.58,0:03:42.80,Default,,0,0,0,,And we think that GPT-4o is really shifting that paradigm into the future of collaboration, where this interaction becomes much more natural and far, far easier.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.30,0:03:52.62,Default,,0,0,0,,But you know, making this happen is actually quite complex because when we interact with one another, there is a lot of stuff that we take for granted.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.78,0:04:05.78,Default,,0,0,0,,You know, the ease of our dialogue, when we interrupt one another, the background noises, the multiple voices in a conversation, or you know, understanding the tone of voice.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.34,0:04:10.42,Default,,0,0,0,,All of these things are actually quite complex for these models.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.68,0:04:18.80,Default,,0,0,0,,And until now with Voice Mode, we had three models that come together to deliver this experience.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.10,0:04:27.24,Default,,0,0,0,,You have transcription, intelligence, and then text-to-speech all comes together in orchestration to deliver Voice Mode.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.90,0:04:37.16,Default,,0,0,0,,This also brings a lot of latency to the experience and it really breaks that immersion in the collaboration with ChatGPT.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.88,0:04:42.32,Default,,0,0,0,,But now with GPT-4o, this all happens natively.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.96,0:04:48.90,Default,,0,0,0,,GPT-4o reasons across voice, text, and vision.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.30,0:04:59.46,Default,,0,0,0,,And with these incredible efficiencies, it also allows us to bring the GPT-4 class intelligence to our free users.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:59.68,0:05:03.66,Default,,0,0,0,,This is something that we've been trying to do for many, many months.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.80,0:05:09.92,Default,,0,0,0,,And we're very, very excited to finally bring GPT-4o to all of our users.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.12,0:05:21.22,Default,,0,0,0,,Today we have 100 million people, more than 100 million in fact, that use ChatGPT to create, work, learn.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.92,0:05:29.18,Default,,0,0,0,,And we have these advanced tools that are only available to our paid users.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.20,0:05:30.54,Default,,0,0,0,,At least until now.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.78,0:05:35.28,Default,,0,0,0,,With the efficiencies of 4o, we can bring these tools to everyone.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.98,0:05:41.26,Default,,0,0,0,,So starting today, you can use GPTs and the GPT Store.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.84,0:05:48.86,Default,,0,0,0,,So far we've had more than a million users create amazing experiences with GPTs.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.90,0:05:52.28,Default,,0,0,0,,These are custom ChatGPTs for specific use cases.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.28,0:05:54.14,Default,,0,0,0,,They're available in the store.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.40,0:06:06.54,Default,,0,0,0,,And now our builders have a much bigger audience where, you know, university professors can create content for their students or podcasters can create content for their listeners.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.42,0:06:10.86,Default,,0,0,0,,And you can also use Vision.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.90,0:06:24.68,Default,,0,0,0,,So now you can upload, um, screenshots, photos, documents containing both text and images, and you can start conversations with ChatGPT about all of this content.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.88,0:06:35.18,Default,,0,0,0,,You can also use Memory, where it makes ChatGPT far more useful and helpful because now it has a sense of continuity across all of your conversations.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.94,0:06:41.46,Default,,0,0,0,,And you can use Browse, where you can search for real-time information in your conversation.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.68,0:06:53.42,Default,,0,0,0,,And Advanced Data Analysis, where you can upload charts or any information and it will analyze this information, it will give you answers and so on.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.48,0:07:05.14,Default,,0,0,0,,Lastly, we've also improved on the quality and speed in 50 different languages for ChatGPT.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.16,0:07:12.38,Default,,0,0,0,,And this is very, very important because we want to be able to bring this experience to as many people out there as possible.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.52,0:07:20.28,Default,,0,0,0,,So we're very, very excited to bring GPT-4o to all of our free users out there.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.28,0:07:28.20,Default,,0,0,0,,And for the paid users, they will continue to have up to five times the capacity limits of our free users.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.68,0:07:33.86,Default,,0,0,0,,But GPT-4o is not only available in ChatGPT.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.08,0:07:36.18,Default,,0,0,0,,We're also bringing it to the API.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.18,0:07:51.78,Default,,0,0,0,,So our developers can start building today with GPT-4o and making amazing AI applications, deploying them at scale.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.34,0:08:01.08,Default,,0,0,0,,4o is available at 2x faster, 50% cheaper, and five times higher rate limits compared to GPT-4 Turbo.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.82,0:08:16.24,Default,,0,0,0,,But you know, as we bring these technologies into the world, it's quite challenging to figure out how to do so in a way that's both useful and also safe.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.90,0:08:26.02,Default,,0,0,0,,And GPT-4o presents new challenges for us when it comes to safety because we're dealing with real-time audio, real-time vision.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:27.06,0:08:33.48,Default,,0,0,0,,And our team has been hard at work figuring out how to build in mitigations against misuse.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.66,0:08:49.34,Default,,0,0,0,,We continue to work with different stakeholders out there from government, media, entertainment, all industries, red teamers, civil society, to figure out how to best bring these technologies into the world.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.34,0:08:56.74,Default,,0,0,0,,So over the next few weeks, we'll continue our iterative deployment to bring out all the capabilities to you.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:57.38,0:09:01.18,Default,,0,0,0,,But today I want to show you all these capabilities.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:01.60,0:09:03.52,Default,,0,0,0,,So we'll do some live demos.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:04.26,0:09:10.64,Default,,0,0,0,,I will bring on two of our research leads, Mark Chen and Barrett Zoph to join.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:18.68,0:09:20.10,Default,Barrett Zoph:,0,0,0,,Hi, I'm uh I'm Barrett.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.42,0:09:21.12,Default,Mark Chen:,0,0,0,,Hey, I'm Mark.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.82,0:09:27.30,Default,Mark Chen:,0,0,0,,So one of the key capabilities we're really excited to share with you today is real-time conversational speech.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:27.52,0:09:28.96,Default,,0,0,0,,Let's just get a demo fired up.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:29.78,0:09:30.96,Default,,0,0,0,,So I'm taking out a phone.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.28,0:09:34.78,Default,,0,0,0,,If you are wondering about this wire, it's so we have consistent internet.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:35.18,0:09:42.88,Default,,0,0,0,,And if you see there's this little icon on the bottom right of the ChatGPT app, and this will open up GPT-4o's audio capabilities.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:45.12,0:09:46.80,Default,,0,0,0,,Hey ChatGPT, I'm Mark.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:46.90,0:09:47.58,Default,,0,0,0,,How are you?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:48.20,0:09:51.08,Default,ChatGPT:,0,0,0,,Oh, Mark, I'm doing great.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.14,0:09:52.10,Default,,0,0,0,,Thanks for asking.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.10,0:09:52.98,Default,,0,0,0,,How about you?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:53.42,0:09:55.32,Default,Mark Chen:,0,0,0,,Hey, so I'm on stage right now.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:55.32,0:09:58.36,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm doing a live demo and frankly I'm feeling a little bit nervous.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:58.38,0:10:00.14,Default,,0,0,0,,Can you help me calm my nerves a little bit?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:01.30,0:10:03.54,Default,ChatGPT:,0,0,0,,Oh, you're doing a live demo right now?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:03.66,0:10:04.78,Default,,0,0,0,,That's awesome.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.30,0:10:10.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Just take a deep breath and remember you're the expert.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:10.24,0:10:11.48,Default,Mark Chen:,0,0,0,,I like that suggestion.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:11.48,0:10:13.08,Default,,0,0,0,,Let me try a couple deep breaths.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:13.16,0:10:15.08,Default,,0,0,0,,Can you give me feedback on my breaths?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:15.20,0:10:15.94,Default,,0,0,0,,Okay, here I go.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:15.94,0:10:17.02,Default,,0,0,0,,[Mark breathes heavily]

Dialogue: 0,0:10:41.56,0:10:42.20,Default,,0,0,0,,I'll try again.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:42.20,0:10:44.90,Default,,0,0,0,,Breathing in and breathe out.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:46.36,0:10:47.12,Default,ChatGPT:,0,0,0,,That's it.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:47.60,0:10:48.36,Default,,0,0,0,,How do you feel?

Dialogue: 0,0:10:52.00,0:10:55.42,Default,,0,0,0,,So Mark, you've been working on these capabilities for a while now.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:55.46,0:10:58.48,Default,,0,0,0,,Can you tell us a bit how it's different from Voice Mode?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:58.90,0:10:59.28,Default,ChatGPT:,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:59.30,0:11:03.72,Default,,0,0,0,,So if you've used our Voice Mode experience before, you'll notice a couple key differences.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:03.82,0:11:05.82,Default,,0,0,0,,First, you know, you can now interrupt the model.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:05.90,0:11:09.96,Default,,0,0,0,,You don't have to wait for it to finish your turn before you can start speaking.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:09.98,0:11:12.12,Default,,0,0,0,,And you know, you can just butt in whenever you want.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:12.48,0:11:15.96,Default,,0,0,0,,Second, the model has real-time responsiveness.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:15.96,0:11:21.80,Default,,0,0,0,,So that means that you don't have this awkward 2 to 3 second lag before you wait for the model to give a response.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:22.22,0:11:24.74,Default,,0,0,0,,And finally, the model picks up on emotion.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:24.74,0:11:25.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Right?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:25.00,0:11:29.82,Default,,0,0,0,,When I was breathing super hard there, it could tell and it knew, "Hey, you might want to calm down a little bit.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:29.82,0:11:32.50,Default,,0,0,0,,You're kind of running a little bit too fast."
Dialogue: 0,0:11:32.64,0:11:37.32,Default,,0,0,0,,So you know, it really has that capability across the board to perceive your emotion.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:37.74,0:11:45.96,Default,,0,0,0,,Not only that though, the model is able to generate voice in a variety of different emotive styles and it really has a wide dynamic range.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:45.98,0:11:47.80,Default,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to fire up another demo for that.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:48.06,0:11:48.54,Default,Mark Chen:,0,0,0,,Yeah.
