Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.36,0:01:47.79,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,And so we really want to pair it with this broader understanding.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.71,0:01:55.85,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,And we're always finding ways to reduce the friction and recently, we made ChatGPT available without the sign-up flow.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.14,0:02:05.56,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,And today, we're also bringing the desktop app to ChatGPT, because we want you to be able to use it wherever you're.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.89,0:02:21.20,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,We note that these models get more and more complex.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.67,0:02:34.61,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,But we want the experience of interaction to actually become more natural, easy, and for you not to focus on the UI at all but just focus on the collaboration with ChatGPT.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.96,0:02:38.00,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,And now the big news.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.00,0:02:45.02,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,Today, we're releasing our newest flagship model, this is GPT-4o.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.28,0:03:04.55,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,And it improves on its capabilities across text, vision, and audio.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.78,0:03:10.97,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,For the past couple of years, we've been very focused on improving the intelligence of these models.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.37,0:03:13.06,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,And they've gotten pretty good.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.07,0:03:20.50,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,But this is the first time that we're really making a huge step forward when it comes to the ease of use.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.87,0:03:30.20,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,And this is incredibly important, because we're looking at the future of interaction between ourselves and the machines.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.68,0:03:42.60,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,And we think that GPT-4o is really shifting that paradigm into the future of collaboration, where this interaction becomes much more natural and far, far easier.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:44.42,0:03:52.53,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,But you know, making this happen is actually quite complex, because when we interact with one another there's a lot of stuff that we take for granted.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.90,0:04:05.76,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,You know the ease of our dialog when we interrupt one another, the background noises, the multiple voices in a conversation, or, you know, understanding the tone of voice.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.46,0:04:10.32,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,All of these things are actually quite complex for, for these models.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.81,0:04:18.67,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,And until now, with voice mode, we had three models that come together to deliver this experience.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.22,0:04:23.12,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,We have transcription, intelligence, and then text to speech.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.50,0:04:27.15,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,All comes together in orchestration to deliver voice mode.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.00,0:04:37.02,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,This also brings a lot of latency to the experience, and it really breaks that immersion in the collaboration with ChatGPT.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.00,0:04:42.11,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,But now, with GPT-4o, this all happens natively.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:43.04,0:04:48.70,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,GPT-4o reasons across voice, text, and vision.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.41,0:04:59.31,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,And with these incredible efficiencies, it also allows us to bring the GPT-4o class intelligence to our free users.

Dialogue: 0,0:10:59.40,0:11:03.57,Default,Mark Chen,0,0,0,,So if you've used our voice mode experience before, you'll notice a couple of key differences.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:03.94,0:11:05.52,Default,Mark Chen,0,0,0,,First, you know, you can now interrupt the model.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:06.03,0:11:11.98,Default,Mark Chen,0,0,0,,You don't have to wait for it to finish your turn before you can start speaking, and, you know, you can just butt in whenever you want.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:12.60,0:11:15.96,Default,Mark Chen,0,0,0,,Second, the model is real-time responsiveness.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:16.05,0:11:21.61,Default,Mark Chen,0,0,0,,So, that means that you don't have this awkward two to three second lag before you wait for the model to give a response.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:22.34,0:11:24.99,Default,Mark Chen,0,0,0,,And finally, the model picks up an emotion, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:25.03,0:11:27.71,Default,Mark Chen,0,0,0,,When I was breathing super hard there, it could tell on it.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:27.77,0:11:29.80,Default,Mark Chen,0,0,0,,You, hey, you may want to calm down a little bit.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:29.87,0:11:32.41,Default,Mark Chen,0,0,0,,You're, kind of, running a little bit too fast.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:32.75,0:11:37.14,Default,Mark Chen,0,0,0,,So, you know, it really has that capability across the board to perceive your emotion.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:37.85,0:11:43.45,Default,Mark Chen,0,0,0,,Not only that though, the model is able to generate voice in a variety of different emotive styles.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:43.76,0:11:45.89,Default,Mark Chen,0,0,0,,And it really has a wide dynamic range.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:46.09,0:11:47.75,Default,Mark Chen,0,0,0,,So I'm gonna fire up another demo for that.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:47.37,0:11:47.58,Default,Mira Murati,0,0,0,,Awesome.
