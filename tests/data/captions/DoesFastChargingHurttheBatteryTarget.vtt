Does fast charging hurt the battery?

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.789 align:start position:0%
We tested for 167 days. We bought 12

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:08.549 align:start position:0%
phones and split them into fast charge

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:10.310 align:start position:0%
and slow charge groups. Three iPhones

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.470 align:start position:0%
and three Android phones in each. Each

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.070 align:start position:0%
phone ran a discharge app that drains

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.189 align:start position:0%
the battery to 0%. Then recharge to 100%

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:18.790 align:start position:0%
faster slow. We will compare their

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.109 align:start position:0%
battery capacity after 500 cycles which

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.790 align:start position:0%
will take 6 months. To show time

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:43.590 align:start position:0%
passing, we planted some plants.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.709 align:start position:0%
Time flies. The plants didn't survive,

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.069 align:start position:0%
but the experiment did. After 187 days,

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.110 align:start position:0%
iPhone slow charge lost 11.8% capacity.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.709 align:start position:0%
Fast charge lost 12.3% 0.5% more.

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.510 align:start position:0%
Android slow charge last 8.8% 8%. Fast

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.270 align:start position:0%
charge lost 8.5%. 0.3% less. So in our

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.189 align:start position:0%
test, fast charging didn't hurt the battery.
